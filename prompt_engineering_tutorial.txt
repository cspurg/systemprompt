1. Prompt Engineering – IntroductionPrompt Engineering 
Prompt engineering is the process of crafting text prompts that help large  language models (LLMs) generate more accurate, consistent, and creative  outputs. By carefully choosing the words and phrases in a prompt, prompt  engineers can influence the way that an LLM interprets a task and the  results that it produces. 
What are Prompts? 
In the context of AI models, prompts are input instructions or cues that  shape the model's response. These prompts can be in the form of natural  language instructions, system-defined instructions, or conditional  constraints.  
∙ A prompt is a short piece of text that is used to guide an LLM's  response. It can be as simple as a single sentence, or it can be more  complex, with multiple clauses and instructions.  
∙ The goal of a prompt is to provide the LLM with enough information  to understand what is being asked of it, and to generate a relevant  and informative response. 
By providing clear and explicit prompts, developers can guide the model's  behavior and influence the generated output. 
Types of Prompts 
There can be wide variety of prompts which you will get to know during the  course of this tutorial. This being an introductory chapter, let's start with a  small set to highlight the different types of prompts that one can use: 
∙ Natural Language Prompts: These prompts emulate human-like  instructions, providing guidance in the form of natural language cues.  They allow developers to interact with the model more intuitively, using  instructions that resemble how a person would communicate. 
∙ System Prompts: System prompts are predefined instructions or  templates that developers provide to guide the model's output. They  offer a structured way of specifying the desired output format or  behavior, providing explicit instructions to the model. 
6 
  

Prompt Engineering 
∙ Conditional Prompts: Conditional prompts involve conditioning the  model on specific context or constraints. By incorporating conditional  prompts, developers can guide the model's behavior based on  conditional statements, such as "If X, then Y" or "Given A, generate B." 
How Does Prompt Engineering Work? 
Prompt engineering is a complex and iterative process. There is no single  formula for creating effective prompts, and the best approach will vary  depending on the specific LLM and the task at hand. However, there are  some general principles that prompt engineers can follow: 
∙ Start with a clear understanding of the task. What do you want  the LLM to do? What kind of output are you looking for? Once you  have a clear understanding of the task, you can start to craft a  prompt that will help the LLM achieve your goals. 
∙ Use clear and concise language. The LLM should be able to  understand your prompt without any ambiguity. Use simple words  and phrases, and avoid jargon or technical terms. 
∙ Be specific. The more specific you are in your prompt, the more  likely the LLM is to generate a relevant and informative response.  For example, instead of asking the LLM to "write a poem," you could  ask it to "write a poem about a lost love." 
∙ Use examples. If possible, provide the LLM with examples of the  kind of output you are looking for. This will help the LLM to  understand your expectations and to generate more accurate  results. 
∙ Experiment. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to prompt  engineering. The best way to learn what works is to experiment with  different prompts and see what results you get. 
Evaluating and Validating Prompts 
Evaluating prompt effectiveness is crucial to assess the model's behavior  and performance. Metrics such as output quality, relevance, and coherence  can help evaluate the impact of different prompts. User feedback and  human evaluation can provide valuable insights into prompt efficacy,  ensuring the desired output is achieved consistently.

Example 
Take a look at the following example:
import openai 
# Set up your OpenAI API credentials 
openai.api_key = 'Your OpenAI Key' 
# Define the ACT LIKE prompt 
prompt = """ 
ACT LIKE Sherlock Holmes and solve the following mystery: 
You are called to investigate a crime scene where a valuable  diamond necklace has been stolen from a locked room. The room  has no windows, and the only entrance is a solid wooden door.  The door was locked from the inside, and there are no signs of  forced entry. The owner of the necklace claims that nobody  else had access to the room. How did the thief manage to steal  the necklace? 
"""
	



44 

Prompt Engineering 
# Generate a response from the model 
response = openai.Completion.create( 
 engine='text-davinci-003', 
 prompt=prompt, 
 max_tokens=100, 
 n=1, 
 stop=None, 
 temperature=0.7 
) 
# Print the model's response 
print(response.choices[0].text.strip())

The INCLUDE prompt allows us to include specific information in the  response generated by ChatGPT. By using the INCLUDE directive, we can  instruct the language model to include certain details, facts, or phrases in  its output, thereby enhancing control over the generated response. 
Understanding the INCLUDE Directive 
The INCLUDE directive is a special instruction that can be embedded within  the prompt to guide ChatGPT's behavior. It enables us to specify the content  that we want the model to incorporate into its response. When the model  encounters the INCLUDE directive, it interprets it as a signal to include the  following information in its generated output. 
The basic syntax for the INCLUDE directive is as follows: 
User: How does photosynthesis work? 
ChatGPT: Photosynthesis is a process by which plants convert  sunlight into energy. [INCLUDE: Chlorophyll, Carbon dioxide,  and Water]
	



In this example, the user asks a question about photosynthesis, and the  response from ChatGPT includes the content specified within the INCLUDE  directive, namely "Chlorophyll, Carbon dioxide, and Water." By using the  INCLUDE directive, we can ensure that specific details are included in the  response, providing a more comprehensive answer. 
Best Practices for Using the INCLUDE Directive 
To make the most of the INCLUDE directive, here are some best practices  to keep in mind: 
∙ Be Specific: Specify the exact details, facts, or phrases that we  want to include in the response. This helps ensure that the model  includes the desired information accurately. 
∙ Limit the Length: While the INCLUDE directive can be useful for  including additional information, be mindful of the response length.  Including too much content may result in excessively long or verbose  responses. Strike a balance and include only the most relevant details. 
46 

Prompt Engineering 
∙ Use Contextual Prompts: Incorporate the INCLUDE directive  within a contextually rich prompt. By providing relevant context  along with the directive, we can guide the model's understanding  and produce more accurate and coherent responses. 
∙ Experiment and Iterate: Prompt engineering is an iterative  process. Test different variations of the INCLUDE directive and  observe how the model responds. Adjust and refine our prompts  based on the results we obtain. 
Example: Python Implementation 
Let's explore a practical example of using the INCLUDE directive in a Python  script. We will utilize the OpenAI API to interact with ChatGPT.  
In this example, the user asks "How does photosynthesis work?" and he  specifically mentions that the response should INCLUDE the words  "Chlorophyll", "Carbon dioxide, and "Water".
import openai 
# Set your API key here 
openai.api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY' 
def generate_chat_response(prompt): 
 response = openai.Completion.create( 
 engine="text-davinci-003", 
 prompt=prompt, 
 max_tokens=50, 
 temperature=0.8, 
 n=1, 
 stop=None 
 ) 
 return response 
user_prompt = "User: How does photosynthesis work?\n"
	



47 

Prompt Engineering 
chat_prompt = user_prompt + "ChatGPT: Photosynthesis is a  process by which plants convert sunlight into energy.  [INCLUDE: Chlorophyll, Carbon dioxide, and Water]" 
response = generate_chat_response(chat_prompt) 
print(response)
	



Output 
Here, we got the following output:  
Sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll, which is located in the  leaves of a plant. The energy from the sunlight is then used  to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose (sugar) and  oxygen. The glucose is then used by the plant to produce  
energy.

Best Practices for Using the DETERMINE CAUSE Directive 
To make the most of the DETERMINE CAUSE directive, let's consider the  following best practices: 
∙ Provide Clear and Contextual Prompts: Clearly state the event  or situation for which we want to determine the cause. Add relevant  context or specific details to guide ChatGPT's analysis. 
∙ Encourage Reasoning and Explanation: Prompt ChatGPT to provide  not just a list of causes but also explanations or reasoning behind them.  Encourage ChatGPT to elaborate on the relationships between various  factors and how they contribute to the given outcome. 
73 

Prompt Engineering 
∙ Consider Multiple Perspectives: Some events or situations may have  multiple potential causes. Ask ChatGPT to explore various perspectives  or contributing factors to provide a comprehensive analysis. 
∙ Verify and Refine: Validate the generated causes against established  knowledge or research. Iterate on the prompts to improve the accuracy  and relevance of the causes provided by ChatGPT. 
Example Application: Python Implementation 
Let's explore a practical example of using the DETERMINE CAUSE directive  with a Python script that interacts with ChatGPT.  
import openai 
# Set your API key here 
openai.api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY' 
def generate_chat_response(prompt): 
 response = openai.Completion.create( 
 engine="text-davinci-003", 
 prompt=prompt, 
 max_tokens=100, 
 temperature=0.7, 
 n=1, 
 stop=None 
 ) 
 return response 
user_prompt = "User: What could be the causes of obesity?\n" chat_prompt = user_prompt + "ChatGPT: [DETERMINE CAUSE: obesity]" 
response = generate_chat_response(chat_prompt) 
print(response)
	



In this example, we define a function generate_chat_response() that takes  a prompt and uses the OpenAI API to generate a response using ChatGPT.  The chat_prompt variable contains the user's prompt and the ChatGPT

Prompt Engineering 
response, including the DETERMINE CAUSE directive to identify the causes  of obesity. 
Output 
When we run the script, we will receive the generated response from  ChatGPT, including the potential causes specified within the DETERMINE  CAUSE directive. 
Here, the user wants to determine the factors that cause obesity. The user  asks the question: "What could be the causes of obesity?" And, ChatGPT  responds with the following output: 
The most common causes of obesity are overeating and physical  inactivity. Eating high-calorie foods and not getting enough  exercise can lead to weight gain and eventually obesity.  
Other factors that can contribute to obesity include genetic  factors, certain medications, lack of sleep, and hormonal  imbalances.
